It comprises three convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and two fully connected layers, which proved to be sufficiently accurate in classifying handwritten digits. While LeNet-5 demonstrated the power of CNNs in extracting spatial structures from 2D data, it has a modest complexity compared to contemporary models.\n"
