    "In this assignment, you will be working with Xuanting's dataset, which contains 2D data of ship wakes produced from wave simulations. The dataset is available at [Data from: Inferring free surface disturbance properties from Kelvin wakes using convolutional neural network](https://doi.org/10.6075/J0GH9JCX).The goal is to classify the ship wakes into one of three classes: ellipse, monohull, and catamaran.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the dataset and the problem of classifying ship wakes images.\n",
    "- Explore and adjust the baseline model to enhance performance to learn the effects of key hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Analyze and report on the effectiveness of model adjustments."
